Understand Linked Lists:
o	Singly Linked List:
A singly linked list consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. It allows for efficient insertion and deletion at the beginning or end but requires traversal to access elements in between.
Operations:
- Insert: O(1) at the beginning, O(n) at the end (without a tail reference).
- Search: O(n).
- Delete: O(n) (requires traversal to find the node).

o	Doubly Linked List:
A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list but with an additional reference (or pointer) to the previous node. This allows for bidirectional traversal and can make some operations more efficient, such as deletion.
Operations:
- Insert: O(1) at the beginning, O(1) at the end (with a tail reference).
- Search: O(n).
- Delete: O(1) (with a reference to the node to be deleted).

Analysis:
o	Time Complexity Analysis
In a task management system using a singly linked list:
- Addition: O(1) for adding at the head, O(n) for adding at the tail.
- Deletion: O(n) for deleting a node due to traversal.
- Traversal: O(n) for visiting all nodes.
- Search: O(n) for finding a specific task.

o	Advantages of Linked Lists Over Arrays
Linked lists offer several advantages for dynamic data:
- Dynamic Size: They can easily grow or shrink, avoiding the need for resizing.
- Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Insertions and deletions are more efficient than arrays, especially at the beginning or middle, as they donâ€™t require shifting elements.
