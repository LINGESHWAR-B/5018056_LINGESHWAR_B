Understand Recursive Algorithms:
o	Concept of Recursion:
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It simplifies problems by breaking them down into more manageable sub-problems.

o	How It Simplifies Problems:
- Divide and Conquer: Recursion often uses a divide-and-conquer approach to solve problems, making complex problems easier to handle by solving simpler instances.
- Natural Fit: It is a natural fit for problems that can be broken into similar sub-problems, such as calculating sequences, tree traversals, and dynamic programming problems.

Analysis:
o	Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
The recursive algorithm used for financial forecasting often exhibits exponential time complexity, O(2^n), due to overlapping subproblems and redundant computations. Each recursive call generates multiple new calls, which can quickly grow out of control with increasing depth.

o	Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
To enhance efficiency, apply memoization or dynamic programming techniques. By storing previously computed results, you avoid redundant calculations and reduce time complexity to O(n). This approach not only streamlines the forecasting process but also ensures that the tool remains scalable and efficient as data complexity grows.
